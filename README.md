MetMap
======

What is it?
-----------
A script that parses a metroid nes rom file to extract information. Possible use would be pure academic interest or to use the data to render the maps at some later stage.


Current state
-------------

Early work-in-progress.

It only prints various parts of extracted data about the map, rooms, structures and such. 


TODO
----

* Understand how rooms and screens are related
* Understand how rooms and screens and tiles are related
* Write more proper business objects


Further reading
